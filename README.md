# guessing-game
This assignment is a project to create a guessing game for the user visiting my website. This project has been worked on in parts with requirements needed to be fulfilled along the way.
Assuming that the user has read the page, the user will be asked 3 questions about
the information. There will also be a bonus question that requires user to guess
a number. The user will be informed if their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
After the completion of the questions, the user will be informed how many questions
were correct in the form of a score.
