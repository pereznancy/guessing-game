    <h1>Hello World and <script>document.write(newFriend);</script>!</h1>
      <p>My name is Nancy, this is my <i>first</i> webpage, and I am quite
         excited about it!
    <h2>How did you get here?</h2>
      <p>You're probably wondering why you are even here. I'm actually not sure
         myself, but I am glad you are! There are so many people in this world,
         and so little time to make all the friends possible. Thanks to <i>the
         <strong>Internet</i></strong> it's much easier to meet someone that has
         things in common with you. Maybe you want to talk to someone about how
         elephants have four knees, or how a giraffe can go longer without water
         than a camel. Or maybe when you are feeling historical you want to
         talk about the shortest war <em>EVER</em> that only lasted 38 minutes
         before Zanzibar surrendered to England in 1896. Whatever the subject,
         your real life friends might not want to talk about all those cool
         things. So why not make some <i>virtual</i> new friends?</p>
    <h5>Are you still here...?</h5>
    <h6>Keep going if you still are!<br/>*<br/>**<br/>***<br/>****<br/>*****</h6>
    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>Only a tiny spec in this vast universe! Who is also a pitbull lover, language
       enthusiast, and now, also a baby coder. My pup Marley and I are living
       in Portland, as I code my way into the tech world. <br/>It wasn't until
       a bit over 2 years ago that I had a revelation: I could make a career out
       of my love for tech! Weird, I know. As a 26 year old, I felt like I had
       already reached my potential, making my way through various desk jobs in
       the human services world. Technology was never presented to me as a viable
       career path growing up. I worked full time while I finished high school
       and got my associates degree in community college. By the age of 20, I was
       working for a public agency until I moved to Portland and realized my love
       for technology doesn't have to be just a hobby. I decided to go back to
       school and began working on my Computer Engineering degree Spring of '16
       at PSU. Although, I am currently taking a small hiatus from PSU and joined
       Alchemy Code Lab's Coding Bootcamp!

      <h2>What have I learned?</h2>
        <p>I don't have a lot of experience coding, but here's a list
          of different languages I have experience with: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Verilog</li>
            <li>Matlab</li>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Spanish</li>
            <li>French</li>
            <li>American Sign Language</li>
          </ul>
        <p>I know, I know, those last three aren't coding languages...but I did
          say it was a list of different languages</strong>(^.^)</strong> <br/>
          I definitely haven't mastered any of them (although I am pretty fluent
          in Spanish) but I am hopeful I'll continue to get better!<p>

      <h2>But where did I study, you ask?</h2>
        <p>Shamelessly, I have gone through my "What if I want to do this..."
          stages in life. Take a look at the list, and you'll see what I am talking
          about.
          <ol>
            <li>Ventura Community College-Humanities</li>
            <li>Pierce Community College-American Sign Language</li>
            <li>Le Cordon Bleu Culinary Institution-Baking</li>
            <li>Troy University-American Sign Language</li>
            <li>Portland State University-Computer Engineering</li>
            <li>Alchemy Code Lab-Coding Bootcamp</li>
          </ol>
        <p>There is some sense in what seems like madness. There was usually a
          life event, or a financial need, that pushed me to make a decision to
          stop the direction I was moving. I still love baking and signing whenever
          possible, but I have a love for technology like no other.</p>

        <h3>So...where to now?</h3>
          <p>There are so many things I want to do, especially now that I know
            there are limitless possiblities with tech. Below are a few of my
            near-future goals!<p>
            <ul>
              <li>Pass Alchemy Code Lab's BootCamp</li>
              <li>Transition professionally into the Tech Industry</li>
              <li>Gain experience in the Tech Industry</li>
              <li>Work on freelance work to provide a platform for those who don't
                  have technology easily available to them</li>
              <li>Work on starting day/weekend workshops for the kids back home
                  to introduce them to tech</li>
            </ul>
        <h1><script>document.write(newFriend);</script>!</h1>
          <p>Now that you know all of this stuff about me, tell me something about
            you!</p>
